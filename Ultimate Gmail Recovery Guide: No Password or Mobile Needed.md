- Behavioral data (device & location history)

The good news? If you’ve lost access to your password and phone, you **can still recover your Gmail** through alternate verification methods.

## ✅ **What You’ll Need to Recover Gmail Without Password or Phone**

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A working internet connection  
- Access to your **recovery email** (if one was set up)  
- A **device/browser you’ve used to sign in before**  
- Patience — Google’s recovery process can take time

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Guide to Recover Gmail Without Password or Phone**

### **Step 1: Go to the Google Account Recovery Page**

👉 Visit [https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery](https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery)

This is Google’s official recovery tool. Never use third-party websites for account recovery.

---

### **Step 2: Enter Your Gmail Address**

Type the email address you're trying to recover and click **Next**.

---

### **Step 3: Click “Forgot Password?”**

When prompted for your password, click **“Forgot password?”** to initiate the recovery process.

---

### **Step 4: Skip the Phone Verification**

Google will likely attempt to send a verification code to your phone. If you don’t have access:

- Click **“Try another way”**  
- If asked to confirm your identity through your phone, select **“I don’t have my phone”**

---

### **Step 5: Use Your Recovery Email**

If you previously added a **recovery email**, Google will send a verification code to that email.

- Enter the code from your recovery inbox  
- You’ll be prompted to reset your password after verification

📌 *Tip: If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folder.*

---

### **Step 6: Answer Security Questions (If Prompted)**

If no recovery email is available, Google might ask:

- "When did you create this account?"  
- "What is your security question?"  
- "When was your last successful login?"  

Provide accurate or approximate answers—Google uses them to determine if you're the rightful owner.

---

### **Step 7: Confirm Device or Location History**

Google may attempt to verify your identity based on:

- Devices you've used to sign in before  
- Previous locations where you accessed your Gmail  
- Your regular login activity  

💡 *Tip: Use the same device and Wi-Fi/network you commonly used with the account.*

---

### **Step 8: Provide an Alternate Email Address**

As a last resort, Google may ask you to enter another email where they can contact you.

- Use an email you have access to  
- Google may take 24–72 hours to verify your info  
- If successful, you’ll receive a link to reset your password

Check if you're still signed into Gmail on:

- A synced Google app (YouTube, Google Drive, etc.)  

If so, you can **reset your password** directly from within the account under:

Once you’ve regained access, take steps to **avoid future lockouts**:

## 🧭 **When to Create a New Gmail Account**

If all recovery methods fail and Google cannot verify your identity, you may need to:

- Create a new Gmail account  
- Notify your contacts about the new address  
- Secure the new account with multiple recovery options

It’s not ideal, but it’s better than losing everything permanently.
