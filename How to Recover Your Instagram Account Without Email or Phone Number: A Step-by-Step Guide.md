Losing access to your Instagram account can be stressful, especially when you no longer have access to the **email** or **phone number** linked to your account. Whether you’ve forgotten your password, changed your contact information, or your account was hacked, you may feel like you’re locked out with no way to recover it.

But don’t panic just yet! Even if you’ve lost access to both your **email** and **phone number**, there are still ways to recover your Instagram account. In this guide, we’ll show you the steps to regain access to your account using alternative methods.

## 🚨 **Common Reasons for Losing Access to Instagram**

Before we dive into recovery steps, here are a few reasons why users might lose access to their Instagram account:

- **Forgotten password**: Forgetting your password is one of the most common issues.
- **Changed email or phone number**: If you’ve changed your contact information and didn’t update it in your account settings, you may be locked out.
- **Account hacked**: Hackers may change your login credentials and recovery information.
- **Deactivation or deletion**: You might have accidentally deactivated or deleted your Instagram account.

Whatever the reason, Instagram provides recovery options even without your original email or phone number.

## 🧠 **What Instagram Needs to Recover Your Account**

To recover your Instagram account, Instagram typically needs to verify your identity. Here’s what you’ll need to provide:

- **Your Instagram username** (or the name linked to your account)
- **Any details about your account** (e.g., previous contact information, device used, last login location)
- **A current email address** for Instagram to contact you

Now, let’s walk you through the recovery process.

## 🛠 **Step-by-Step Guide: Recover Instagram Account Without Email or Phone Number**

### **Step 1: Open the Instagram App or Website**

Start by opening Instagram on your mobile device or desktop.

1. Open the **Instagram app** or go to the **Instagram website** at [https://www.instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com).
2. On the login screen, tap or click **"Forgot Password?"** (or **"Trouble Logging In?"** on mobile).

---

### **Step 2: Enter Your Username**

Instagram will prompt you to enter the **email address, phone number, or username** associated with your account. Since you don’t have access to your email or phone, enter your **Instagram username**.

- If you don’t remember your username, you may try searching through your contacts or any devices where you were previously logged in.

After entering your username, Instagram will ask if you’d like to receive a reset link via **email** or **SMS**. Since you no longer have access to these options, tap or click on **"Need more help?"** to access additional recovery options.

---

### **Step 3: Request a Login Link via Your Instagram Account (Alternative Method)**

1. **Click on "Need more help?"** and you’ll be taken to Instagram’s **Help Center** page.
2. Choose the option **“My Account Was Hacked”** or **“I Can’t Access My Account”**, depending on your situation.
3. On the next page, Instagram will offer a recovery form. **Enter your Instagram username** and **any additional details** requested.

Instagram will then send an **account recovery link** to the email address associated with your account (even if it’s no longer your primary email). If you can still access any old inbox, check it for the recovery link. Otherwise, you’ll need to move to the next method.

### **Step 4: Use Instagram’s Identity Verification Process**

If the above methods don’t work, Instagram offers a **manual identity verification process** to recover your account:

1. Go to the **Instagram Login page** and select **"Trouble Logging In?"**.
2. Enter your **username** and click **"Need more help?"**.
3. Follow the instructions to submit a **photo of yourself** holding a **code** sent by Instagram. This code is a set of characters that Instagram generates to ensure you're the legitimate account owner.
4. Instagram will review the photo and may send you an email with the next steps.

**Tip**: Make sure the photo you submit clearly shows your face and the code. This helps Instagram verify your identity.

### **Step 5: Contact Instagram Support Directly**

If the above steps still don’t work, try reaching out to Instagram Support directly.

- **Go to Instagram’s Help Center** and scroll down to **"Contact Us"**.
- Select **"I need help with my account"** and choose **"My Account Was Hacked"**.
- Provide as much detail as possible about your account (username, email, device used), and describe the issue.

Instagram’s support team will attempt to verify your identity and provide further instructions on how to regain access.

## 🔧 **What to Do If You Still Can’t Recover Your Account**

In rare cases, Instagram may be unable to verify your identity or restore your account. If this happens, here are your options:

### ✅ **Create a New Account**
If you can’t recover your old account, you may need to start over with a new Instagram account. Be sure to:

- Use a **different email address** and **phone number** that you can access.
- Update your **security settings** to ensure your account is secure from future hacks.

### ✅ **Inform Your Contacts**
If your account was hacked and used to send malicious content to your followers, inform your contacts about the situation and share your new account details.

## 🛡 **How to Secure Your Instagram Account After Recovery**

Once you regain access to your Instagram account, take the following steps to prevent future issues:

### 1. **Update Your Email and Phone Number**
Make sure both your **email** and **phone number** are current, and update them in Instagram’s security settings.

### 2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
Turn on **two-factor authentication** (2FA) for added security. This will require both your password and a verification code sent to your phone whenever you log in.

### 3. **Create a Strong Password**
Ensure that your new password is strong and unique, and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Use a **password manager** to securely store your credentials.

### 4. **Check Account Activity**
Go to **Settings > Security > Login Activity** to review any suspicious logins or devices. If something looks out of place, immediately log out of any unfamiliar devices.
