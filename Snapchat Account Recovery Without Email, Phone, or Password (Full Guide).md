- A **valid email you currently have access to** (for support communication)

Now let’s walk through the process step by step.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Guide: Recover Snapchat Without Email, Phone, or Password

### 🔹 **Step 1: Go to the Snapchat Support Page**

Start by visiting the official support page:  
👉 [https://support.snapchat.com](https://support.snapchat.com)

Navigate to:

1. **Contact Us**  
2. Select **"I can't access my account"**  
3. Choose **"I forgot my password"**  
4. Click on **"Still need help?"**

You’ll be asked to enter:

- **Snapchat username** (required)
- **Your current email address** (where Snapchat can contact you)
- **Mobile number** (if you remember it—even if you no longer have access)
- **Description of the issue**

📌 **Pro Tip:** In the description, explain everything clearly and politely. For example:

> *“Hi Snapchat Support, I’ve lost access to my Snapchat account and no longer have access to the email or phone number associated with it. I also forgot the password. My username is [your username]. I used to log in with a [device name/model] from [city, country]. Please help me recover my account. I can verify any additional details you may need.”*

### 🔹 **Step 3: Include Helpful Details**

- The approximate **date you created your Snapchat**
- The **type of device** you last used (e.g., iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21)
- Last known **login location**
- Previous **friends or contact names** on Snapchat (optional)

These small details help Snapchat verify that you’re the rightful owner.
