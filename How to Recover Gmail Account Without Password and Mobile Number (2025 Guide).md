## **Step-by-Step Guide to Recover Gmail Without Password and Mobile Number**

### **1. Go to the Google Account Recovery Page**

Start by visiting the official [Google Account Recovery page](https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery).

### **2. Enter Your Gmail Address**

Type in the Gmail address you’re trying to recover and click **Next**.

### **3. Click on “Forgot Password?”**

Google will now ask you to enter the last password you remember. If you don’t remember any, click on **“Try another way”**.

### **4. Skip the Mobile Number Option**

If Google asks to send a verification code to your phone number (which you no longer have), click **“I don’t have my phone”** or **“Try another way”** again.

## **5. Use a Recovery Email (If You Set One Up)**

If you added a recovery email to your Gmail account, Google will now give you the option to send a verification code to that email.

- **Check your recovery email inbox** for the code.
- Enter the code into the Google recovery form.
- Follow the steps to reset your password.

---

## **6. Answer Security Questions**

If you didn’t set a recovery email, Google might offer to let you **answer the security question** you set up when you created the account (e.g., "What is your first pet’s name?").

- Try to answer it correctly.
- If successful, Google will guide you to create a new password.

## **7. Confirm Last Sign-In Details (Device/Location)**

Google uses advanced AI to verify identity. You might be asked questions like:

- When did you last access this account?
- What device did you use most often?
- What location did you usually log in from?

Try to **answer as accurately as possible** to prove ownership.

## **8. Provide an Email Where Google Can Reach You**

If all else fails, Google may prompt you to **enter a new email address** where they can contact you about your account recovery request.

- Enter an accessible and active email address.
- Google may take 24–72 hours to verify your information and get back to you.

---

## **Tips to Improve Your Chances of Recovery**

- Use the **same device** and **same browser** you previously used to access Gmail.
- Try to **log in from the usual location** (like your home or workplace Wi-Fi).
- Be **patient**—you might need to attempt the process a few times.

## **What If Nothing Works?**

If you still can’t recover your Gmail account:

1. **Try again after 24–48 hours.** Google may be more lenient on the second or third attempt.
2. **Check your devices.** If you're still signed in on another device, you can reset your password from there.
3. **Create a new Gmail account.** Sometimes, starting fresh is the only option—but make sure to set up recovery options properly this time!
