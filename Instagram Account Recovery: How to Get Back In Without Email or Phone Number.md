## üõ† **Step-by-Step Guide: How to Recover Your Instagram Account Without Email or Phone Number**

### **Step 1: Go to the Instagram Login Page**

1. Open the **Instagram app** or go to the **Instagram website**: [https://www.instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com).
2. On the login screen, click on **"Forgot Password?"** (or **"Trouble Logging In?"** on the mobile app).

---

### **Step 2: Enter Your Instagram Username**

Instagram will ask for **your email address**, **phone number**, or **username** to locate your account. Since you don‚Äôt have access to your email or phone, type in your **Instagram username**.

- If you can‚Äôt remember your username, try searching your old devices or email inboxes for any clues.
- You can also search for your username through **Google** or by checking **social media** platforms where you may have shared your Instagram handle.

Once you‚Äôve entered your username, Instagram will try to send a password reset link to your email or phone number. Since you don‚Äôt have access to either, click or tap on **"Need more help?"** at the bottom of the screen to access additional recovery options.

---

### **Step 3: Use the ‚ÄúNeed More Help?‚Äù Option**

1. After clicking **"Need more help?"**, you‚Äôll be redirected to Instagram‚Äôs **Help Center**.
2. Here, Instagram will offer several recovery options, including choosing if your account was **hacked** or if you‚Äôre having trouble logging in for another reason.

If the typical password recovery methods aren‚Äôt available, proceed to **‚ÄúI can‚Äôt access this email address or phone number‚Äù** and fill out the form with the details requested.

---

### **Step 4: Submit a Request for Account Recovery**

1. Instagram will ask you to provide your **Instagram username** and **any details you have about the account**. This includes information like:
   - The **email address** associated with your account (even if it‚Äôs no longer your current one).
   - **Device information**: Information about the phone or tablet you last used to access Instagram.
   - **Location**: Where you last logged into Instagram (city or country).

2. In the **description box**, explain that you no longer have access to your email or phone number. Be as detailed as possible to help Instagram verify your identity.

Once submitted, Instagram will send an **account recovery link** to the email address you provided in the form.

### **Step 5: Verify Your Identity Through Instagram‚Äôs Manual Verification Process**

If you don‚Äôt have access to any of the information linked to your account (email, phone number), Instagram may ask you to submit a **manual identity verification**.

1. Instagram may request a **photo of yourself** holding a **code** that they send to you. The code is typically a series of random characters that Instagram generates for verification.
2. Ensure the photo is clear and shows both your face and the verification code. This helps Instagram confirm that it‚Äôs you trying to regain access.

Instagram will review the verification photo and send you further instructions based on the results.

### **Step 6: Contact Instagram Support Directly (If All Else Fails)**

If none of the above options work, it‚Äôs time to contact **Instagram‚Äôs support team** directly:

1. Go to **Instagram‚Äôs Help Center** and look for the **"Contact Us"** section.
2. Choose the option **"I need help with my account"** and select **"My Account Was Hacked"** or **"I Can't Access My Account"** depending on your situation.
3. Provide all the necessary details (username, email, device info, last login, etc.) to help Instagram verify your account.

Instagram support will review your case and get back to you with a resolution. The process can take a few business days, so be patient.
